///
/// There are four kinds of messages:
///     subscription - A connection between `Publisher` and `Subscriber`.
///     value - An element in the sequence.
///     error - The sequence ended with an error (`.failure(e)`).
///     complete - The sequence ended successfully (`.finished`).
///
/// Both `.failure` and `.finished` are terminal messages.
